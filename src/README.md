# PracticeGitIgnore Project
This project is a simple Java program created for practicing Git and
`.gitignore` usage. The goal is to set up a basic Java project, add a
`.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files, and push the project
to GitHub.
## Project Structure
- `src/PracticeGitIgnore.java`: Contains the main Java program with a
  "Hello from PracticeGitIgnore!" message.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes unnecessary files like IDE configuration
  files, compiled `.class` files, and OS-specific files.
- `README.md`: Provides information about the project and setup
  instructions.
## Usage
To run the program, execute the following in the terminal:
```bash
java src/PracticeGitIgnore
